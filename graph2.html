  <p class="w3-center">The first line graph compares the changes in the total price of all the transactions in the mainland. Generally, the total price went down from just above $60 billion to $44 billion between 2013 and 2020.</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>In terms of calligraphy & painting, the price was the highest over the period. The figure first decreased from $40bn to $28bn between 2013 and 2015. After that, it went up slightly to $34bn in 2017 but dropped even further to only $20bn in 2019. Finally, there was a rise from $20bn to $24bn from 2019 to 2020. In comparison, the total price of oil paints & modern, ceramics, ancient books, and other types of artifacts remained constant and they were much lower than calligraphy & painting. This is because the amount of calligraphy and ceramics in China is significantly larger than the others, this meant that although the total price of calligraphy and ceramics is higher, doesn’t mean the average price is. </p>
  <p class='w3-center'>There are many newly made calligraphies in China that are on auction as well as the ancient ones. The production of calligraphy in China is constant, thus the number of calligraphies on auction will only increase over time. Which strengthened the unsurpassed position of the total price of the Chinese calligraphy in the graph. </p>

  <p class="w3-center">On the other hand, the second line graph shows the change in the total price of all transactions oversea. Overall, the total price fell significantly between 2013 and 2020(from $23bn to $14bn).</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>Interestingly, while calligraphy & painting was the highest on the mainland, ceramics were more popular and more expensive internationally. The total price of ceramics increased and reached a peak of $15bn in 2015. However, there was a sharp decrease in the total price to $8bn in 2016. Then, the number remained stable but fell to only $5bn by the end of 2020. In terms of calligraphy & painting, the total price was very stable between 2013 and 2017 at around $7.5bn. Yet the total price fell steadily to $2.9bn in 2020.</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>On the contrary, we can see in the oversea market, that the total price, in US Dollars, of ceramics s the highest for over 7 years. This is because, in the early 20th and the late 19th century, China was at the war. This meant that antique dealers could easily enter and exit China with artifacts, In comparison ceramics are the one which is relatively durable and with the most credibility in the world, due to globalization and trading in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. For example in 1900, during the 8-country Alliances, China suffered the most importantly the army that invaded China robbed artifacts including calligraphy, ceramics, and bronze artifacts, both from the palace and from the people. This meant that the existence of Chinese ceramics overseas is relatively higher than in the other categories. Hence, the total price is higher.</p>
