  <h3 class="w3-center colorGold">Legend in Jizhou Kiln —— Muye Cup</h3>
  <p class='w3-center w3-large'>Lo Hau Lam</p>
  <p class="w3-center">For a long time, Chinese people have been accustomed to using ceramic utensils. It  developed from the embryonic form of production in the Qin and Han dynasties to the mature  technology in the Ming and Qing dynasties. With a long history, the tradition of porcelain is  closely related to our culture, which influence each other. The audience of porcelain has always  been very wide: from princes and nobles to ordinary people. Aiming at satisfying the needs of the  social strata, a large number of porcelain baking places were slowly appearing. In ancient times,  the traffic was extremely inconvenient, which made fragile articles such as porcelain unable to be  well protected and transported to other areas. Therefore, a large number of ceramic kiln mouths  have been produced in different areas. Considering the differences in weather and climate, soil  quality and water quality, cultural understanding and religion, they made all kinds of porcelain  with different styles and advantages for the ancient Chinese ceramics industry. Among them, the  pinnacle works produced by chance and coincidence have always been well known by everyone.  There are “five famous kilns”: Ru, Guan, Ge, Jun and Ding. There are also eight kiln systems: Ru  Kiln, Yaozhou Kiln, Guan Kiln, Ding Kiln, Cizhou Kiln, Jun Kiln, Jingdezhen Kiln and Ge Kiln.  These are all made by ancestors to meet the needs of life. As a result, some are made beautifully  and some are simple. This is not because the craftsman’s skills or intentions are not enough, but to  meet the needs of diverse users. Although the porcelain of Jizhou Kiln is not as famous as the  porcelain produced by Jianzhan, who also produced black glazed porcelain, the leaf pattern cup  produced by Jizhou Kiln is unique in the firing process and incomparable in aesthetics. Muye cup  of Jizhou kiln is similar to the porcelain produced by other kilns. </p>
  <p class='w3-center'>“Money, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea, piano, chess, calligraphy, poetry, wine and  flower.” The first seven items are the necessities of life, while the last seven items are the  recreation outside daily life. The richer a society becomes in material terms, the more developed  entertainment will be. This is true at all times and in all countries. Undoubtedly, the most famous  is the Song Dynasty, a thousand years ago. “Famous officials can judge water from time to time,  and eminent monks love to compete for tea from time to time.” People in the Song Dynasty paid  special attention to spiritual enjoyment because of their material satisfaction. Tea competition is  one of them. The activity of fighting tea gave rise to the theory of “tea ceremony”. With the advent  of the “tea ceremony”, the most important condition is tea props. Among the tea props, the most  dazzling and legendary one is the tea cup. There were enormous distinct styles of tea cups in the  Song Dynasty. The materials included metal, porcelain and pottery, and the colors included black  in the south and white in the north. What this article is talking about is the pearl in the southern  black glazed porcelain and the treasure of tea cups in the Northern Song Dynasty. The legend sung  by later generations-Muye cup (Fig. 1 and 2). </p>
  <p class='w3-center'>With black glaze as the base, the Muye cup and gold leaf float on it, forming a classic contrast  colour scheme of black and gold. However, the subtlety of the Muye cup is not in the colourful  glaze colour or the beautiful outline, but only in the quiet and tranquil golden shimmering leaves.  The black glaze and gold leaves of the Muye cup show not only the simple and generous  aesthetics of the Song people, but also the philosophy of the Song people’s road to simplicity,  furthermore, even the highest craft of the Song people. Such exquisite works of art can’t help but  make it occur to us: Are these finished products easily thought by craftsmen at that time? Just a  handful? Of course not. The unique aesthetics of the Muye cup stem from the interaction of the  high design and the highly refined technology. The craftsmen have perfected the products through  careful observation and experiments over time. It means that there are many experimental  products in Jizhou kiln. Since 1950s, Jizhou kiln site has been investigated many times. From  1980 to 1981, Jiangxi Provincial Cultural Relics Team and Ji’an County Cultural Relics  Management Office jointly made a detailed survey of kiln sites and opened 25 exploratory  trenches. They cleaned up a dragon kiln and workshop site, thus obtaining a large number of  porcelain pieces and kiln furniture. Abundant information has been accumulated for  comprehensive understanding and research of Jizhou kiln. </p>

  <p class='w3-center'>Although the unearthed relics are usually fragments, we can still notice the aesthetics of the  Song Dynasty through the Muye cup handed down from generation to generation. It perfectly  displays the characteristics of the Muye cup in Song Dynasty. The brown and black background  colour and the golden leaves, the glaze that changes with the light and shadow, echo each other  with the clear vein on the leaves, which makes people not turn their eyes. The Muye cup in this  private collection is 47 high and 105mm wide. Convergent mouth, high bottom foot, such tea cup  is usually the early works of Jizhou kiln. With oval cup mouth, its bottom has a small arc profile,  which is the trace left by pulling the embryo. The whole tea cup is marvellous in shape and  smooth in lines. Although thousands of years have passed, it still reveals elegance in its bones. In  practical use, the shape of the convergent mouth is more convenient to keep warm and carry than  that of the open mouth, as well as less likely to be damaged. For example, in modern Japan,  matcha tea is usually kept warm in winter by tea cups with folded mouths, while in summer it is  cooled by open tea cups. </p>
  <p class='w3-center'>The process of Muye cup is very complicated. From the sequence of pottery clay, embryo  drawing, glaze adjustment and firing, the temperature in the kiln and even the variety selection of  leaves and the season of picking leaves are also exquisite. Before firing, it is necessary to apply a  layer of black glaze on the clay. Then a light glaze is applied to the treated leaves. Finally, the  leaves are pasted on the pottery body and fired in a kiln. Under the high-temperature firing, the  leaf body is completely burnt, and finally the vein and the cup are integrated. Considering every  Muye cup is made of natural leaves, there will be no duplication of leaf lines and veins. Like this  Muye cup, the state is very stretched and natural, which allows us to fully see the folding  relationship and shape of the leaves. However, the veins on the leaves are not very clear. This is  because the temperature at that time is not stable. Sometimes the temperature in the kiln is too  high, which leads to the veins of the leaves being fused with the black base glaze. Consequently,  the veins of the leaves become blurred. There are varieties of leaves in the Muye cup, some are  Chinese parasol leaves and some are mulberry leaves. Chinese parasol leaves play a very essential  role in Chinese culture. From Zhuangzi’s saying, “Planting Chinese parasol, attracting Phoenix” to  Huainanzi’s statement “When a leaf of Chinese parasol falls, the world knows the autumn.”, both  these famous sayings of celebrities use Chinese parasol as allusions. The Chinese parasol leaves in  the Muye cups are the sustenance of the Song people. The shape of mulberry leaves is extended  and the leaves are large. In addition, mulberry leaves also support the production of silk, one of  China’s most fabulous trade goods. Therefore, the ancients also had distinguished feelings for  mulberry leaves. </p>

    <p class='w3-center'>The Centre for Conservation and Technology Research of Harvard University Art Museum has  tested the chemical composition of brown-black porcelain in the Song Dynasty, in which there are  potassium oxide (K2O), aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and sodium oxide (Na2O) in the fetal soil. The  reason is that the local fetal soil in Ji’an contains feldspar and quartz. The appearance of these  elements strengthened the strength of the tire soil and greatly improved the success rate of firing.  At the high temperature around the end of 1300℃, the clay contained in the embryo of Muye cup  was converted into 3A12O3 2x2sio2 by heat, which is mullite that often appears in porcelain. In  addition, the addition of some fluxing elements such as iron oxide (FeO), magnesium oxide  (MgO), sodium oxide (Na2O), manganese oxide (MnO) and calcium oxide (CaO) reduced the  melting point of minerals in glaze water, making it easier for the mouth of ancient firewood kiln to  reach the required temperature. This Muye cup can also see various features from other Jizhou  kiln tea cups. For example, the small bags around the objects were made by the Jizhou kiln at a  high temperature of about 1,300 degrees with copper and iron as colours. Therefore, when firing  in a kiln, the small bubbles contained in the embryo pulling process are covered by a thick glaze  layer. When the firing is finished and the utensils are cooled, the bubbles are blocked between the  glaze layer and the adobe when they break out. As a result, the surface of the utensils will have  bumps of various sizes and disparate protrusion degrees. Simultaneously, there are sometimes  dense, sometimes loose and irregular kiln slag and kiln stickiness scattered on the bottom glaze.  This was caused by the backward firing technology and unstable control of the temperature. When  impurities get into the soil or mixed into the glaze, those impurities will enter the high temperature  with the utensils. Some impurities with low melting point will melt in the glaze, which can’t be  seen by naked eyes. Some impurities with high melting point will form one or two small spots,  which are hard to the touch and become convex. These are all due to the characteristics of the time  when the technology was not advanced and mature. These defect are tolerable in modern  standardised assembly line production, which can be avoid by technical improvement. On the  contrary, in the Song Dynasty 1000 years ago, these were regarded as inevitable and irresistible  defects. This is not only because the craft of burning was not as developed as it is now, but also  because the aesthetics of the users of the Muye cup fused religious concepts such as Buddhism  and Taoism. Therefore, in their view, these defects are no longer the disadvantages, but the  essential features that nature has given a work of art. </p>
    <p class="w3-center">Another distinguished feature of this Muye cup is that the bottom foot has a chamfer  relationship of 2 to 3 degrees. This trait is disparate from other tea cups from Jizhou kiln. The  reason for this is that the average Jizhou kiln porcelain has a flat sole (Fig. 6) and does not have an  inverted foot, but this one is unique. In addition, the bottom foot of this Muye cup is about 80mm  high (Fig. 7), and the inner and outer bottom feet have been cut obliquely. This is also very rare in  the porcelain of Jizhou kiln. It also bears the marks of embryo pulling and the fingernails of the  craftsmen of the time. The potholes on this Muye cup are due to the fact that the soil used in  Jizhou kiln is clay similar to kaolin, and there are a lot of impurities hidden in the clay when firing  each hanging glaze. Therefore, it is concave and convex after firing. In addition, the objects made  of kaolinite may look like pottery, but in fact they have the hardness and sound of metal, which  causes the craftsmen to use more force to cut and become unstable when trimming. All these tell  us that this Muye cup is not a product of batch burning. What’s crucial is that it can also prove that  craftsmen at that time were not familiar with the manufacturing technology of Muye cups.  Therefore, this Muye cup may be an experimental product when the early Jizhou kiln first  developed the Muye cup. </p>

    <p class='w3-center'>Due to the inherent firing problem of Jizhou kiln, the tyre quality is hard and brittle, which is  easy to be damaged compared with other kiln mouths. As a result, most of the porcelain in Jizhou  kiln has cracks and lines. In order to avoid this situation, craftsmen at that time specially applied a  thick and moist bottom glaze, which made the glaze fully wrap the earth tire. However, disparate  degrees of oxidation caused by various local heating and temperatures led to diverse changes of  glaze colour after firing. For example, the brown colour of this Muye cup is caused by excessive  oxidation of colouring agent after high temperature in the kiln. Fortunately, this Muye cup is very  complete, without any damage, which is really rare. Moreover, it has so many traces of the  burning at that time, which greatly increases its value in historical research. At present, most of the  wooden lanterns are collected by Jiangxi Provincial Museum, Jizhou Kiln Museum and some 
private or public museums in Japan. During the Tang and Song Dynasties, Japanese people  influenced by Chinese culture specially appreciated black glazed tea cups. In their eyes, Muye cup  is the top priority in the black glaze category, they thus wantonly purchase these items. Therefore,  there are very few Muye cups in the market at present, which also hit record highs in the auction.  For example, Lot No.3162 in Christie’s autumn auction in 2016 was a Muye cup, which was  finally sold at a high price of HK$ 2.2 million (Fig. 8). Also, No.5026 in the spring auction of  China Trade Shengjia in 2019 was also a Muye cup, which was finally sold at 1.5 million RMB.  In recent years, the rising price of wood leaves tells people its preciousness. </p>
    <p class="w3-center">Muye cup is not only extremely rare in modern times, but also very precious in the Song  Dynasty. This is because the Muye cup was burned by the royal family of the Northern Song  Dynasty and given to the venerable monks at that time. This was because many high-ranking  officials and dignitaries were Buddhist believers. Therefore, the places for monks' activities in the  Song Dynasty became extremely extensive. The monasteries were not only religious centres and  educational centres, but also artistic centres and economic centres. Then one can imagine how  important and honourable the status of the host of the religious, artistic and economic center is.  And their living environment and state are not dominated by economic interests. Therefore, for  them at that time, the Muye cup was not a treasure won by value, but an honour, spiritual  enjoyment and artistic appreciation. It’s nothing in their hands. Of course, in addition to showing  identity and aesthetic appreciation, the main use of tea cups is still competing tea. The design of  Jizhou kiln Muye cup is very suitable for the Song people’s tea competition entertainment. The  shape and the opening angle of the tea cup pulling embryo are very easy to control, and the small  volume is convenient to carry. In addition, when outdoors, the metal elements such as iron in the  tire soil and glaze can also play a significant role in heat preservation. These are all the  characteristics of the Muye cup as a practical device. </p>
    <p class="w3-center">Besides economic value and historical research, the artistic attainments of Muye cup are also  extremely high. In the article on ceramic leaf pattern decoration, Yu Yong and Yao Zhimin of  Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute once concluded that it (refers to leaf pattern decoration) excels in  nature, coming from nature but higher than nature. It edifies and condenses the human soul, giving  people beautiful hope and comfort. Muye cup is also a kind of leaf pattern, even the most  exquisite and dazzling one. It is a sublime new art that is produced after the purification and  processing of the full ceramic decoration experience and skills of Jizhou kiln craftsmen. Human  beings love nature in essence, because we are from nature. The Song people realised this very  early, and their yearning for nature is reflected in this small tea cup, which is a good blend of  Buddhist philosophy of “one leaf and one meditation” and people’s minimalist aesthetics in the  Northern Song Dynasty. Coupled with the teaching methods of Buddhist art and literature, Muye  Zhan was more suitable for the needs of the monks at that time. For Buddhism, the Muye cup is  not only a utensil for drinking tea, but also the philosophical meaning and Buddhist doctrine of  “one dust, one Buddha country, one leaf, one Buddha” expressed by it are more important. For  this reason, both Japan and China, which are deeply influenced by Buddhist culture, appreciate  and pursue the Muye cup very much (Fig. 9). </p>
    <p class="w3-center">In ancient and modern times, all over the world, the goal of human beings has always been to  meet their own desires in a changing way, from material satisfaction to self-spiritual satisfaction.  People are constantly exploring and creating in times of dissatisfaction, which has shaped our  modern human civilisation. Although human society has gone through thousands of years and  explored for thousands of years, every time the goal is met again and again, there are new issues  and new goals immediately. We have been searching for it from generation to generation, just as  the leaves on the branches keep growing year after year. Nature, like us, grows in constant  renewal. The leaves at the bottom of the cup, from germination to falling, are finally burned in the  tea cup. It has undergone changes again and again, sublimated in constant changes, and finally  became a classic handed down to this day. Its journey is still not over, or will never end.  Circulation from generation to generation, or use, or auction, or collection, or burial. Although  everyone’s understanding and function to it vary from each other, every distinction endows it with  deeper historical traces and precipitation. As long as people’s spiritual requirements have reached  a certain height, artistic aesthetics and philosophy will coincide with the concept of Muye cup. It  is why Muye cup has been enduring for thousands of years, sought after by different people in  various parts of the world. </p>
