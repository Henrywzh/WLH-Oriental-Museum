  <p class="w3-center">The stacked plot shows the number of transactions of various artifacts from 2013 to 2020. Overall, there was a decreasing trend in the number of transactions(from over 350000 to around 250000).</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>According to the graph, calligraphy & painting were clearly the most. In 2013 the number was 170000, yet over the next few years, it fell dramatically to only 74000 in 2020. Ceramics were also very popular in Mainland, still, there was a minor drop in the number of transactions from 83000 to 72000. On the other hand, the number remained the same for oil paints & modern, ancient books and other artifacts. </p>
  <p class='w3-center'>The main reason for this circumstance it's again the production of calligraphy and paintings and of course ceramics or constant and often in mainland China because of the existence of places like Jingdezhen. This meant that more calligraphy and ceramics that are able to be put on auctions. Due to oil paints and ancient books with good qualities are rare in mainland China, as one of them isn’t originated from China,  and the other is hard to preserve. The transaction of oil paints and ancient books will be lower than calligraphies and ceramics. </p>

  <p class="w3-center">In terms of oversea transactions, there were large fluctuations in numbers. In addition, most of the transactions are related to ceramics and calligraphy & painting. </p>
  <p class='w3-center'>Regarding ceramics, the number started at 33000 and reached a peak of 35000 in 2015. However, it dropped to 23000 in 2020. Similarly, the number of transactions related to calligraphy & painting also stood high at 9000 in 2013 but then fell steadily to 4000 by the end of 2020. Whereas, oil paints & modern arts varied around 25000 over the period.</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>This is due to, in the early 20th and the late 19th century, China was at war. This meant that antique dealers, like LuQingZai and ZhangBoJu, could easily enter and exit the Chinese artifacts market, as it was unregulated. For example in 1900, during the 8-country Alliances, China suffered the most importantly the army that invaded China robbed artifacts including calligraphy, ceramics, and bronze artifacts, both from the palace and from the people. This meant that the existence of Chinese ceramics overseas is relatively higher than in the other categories. Hence, the transactions are higher in numbers. </p>
