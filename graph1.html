  <p class="w3-center">The bar chart gives information about the total price of recent Chinese artifacts transactions between 2013 and 2020. Overall, there is a decreasing trend in terms of the total price. In addition, it is apparent that the mainland Chinese artifacts industry is significantly larger than oversea.</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>A more detailed look at the bar chart shows that in 2013, the total price was over 80 billion USD(60 billion USD was mainland while around 20 billion USD was oversea). However, the total price fell gradually between 2013 and 2016 to just below 70 billion dollars. Although in 2017, the number went up slightly to $70bn, it continued to fall to approximately $60bn in 2020. On the other hand, the line graph shows the variation in the average price of transactions. In general, the average price remained relatively stable for transactions in the mainland while the oversea mean price varied significantly. Surprisingly, even though the total price was higher for the mainland, the mean price per transaction was much lower when compared to oversea prices. Between 2013 and 2017, the mainland average price saw a steady rise from $17000 to $21000. After that, the numbers decreased to only $15000 in 2019 and ended at around $18000 in 2020. In comparison, the average price for oversea transactions fluctuated dramatically from 2013 to 2018 at around $50000. The mean price reached a peak of $58000 in 2017 but then it went down to only $45000 by the end of 2020.</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>In conclusion, while the total price was higher for the mainland transactions, the average price per transaction was significantly more for the oversea transactions.</p>
