  <p class="w3-center">Here are 4 pie charts showing the differences between the total price in 2020 (right) and the number of transactions (left) of the mainland and oversea arts markets. The transactions already removed the ones which are ‘close lot’. (unsuccessfully sold)</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>The transactions in the mainland market were more even compared to the oversea market, where ceramics and calligraphy had about the same proportion of the market, which was around 31%. Interestingly, the ‘others’ section, included bamboo and wood stationeries and instruments for tea or incense ceremonies. This part also took 27.1% of the whole market. Due to the existence and popularity of ancient books and oil paints on the mainland being low, the amount that went on auctions and got into transactions will, thus, have a lesser percentage of the market. While the transaction of calligraphy and ceramics was almost even in the mainland art market, the total price of calligraphy in the whole market was significantly larger than ceramics; where it took 55.8% of the market and ceramics only had 23.9%. On the contrary, in the oversea market, ceramics was the main option of the auctions, it had 77.1% of all the transactions in the market. It is also reflected in the total price, which is 36.5% of the total. However, oil paints had only 7.4% of all the transactions but it was 40.6% of the total price.</p>
  <p class='w3-center'>All of the situations are because of the average price or there were some magnificent pieces that were sold that year in that specific category. The average price of calligraphy arts was higher than the ceramics in the mainland market. This is proven when we look at the ‘others’ section, it holds 27.1% of the whole market but only has 8.1% of the total price. Hence the proportion of calligraphy was higher than ceramics in the total price. The same in the oversea market, the average price of oil paints was hugely different from other categories, thus, the percentage of oil paints in the total price was high. </p>
