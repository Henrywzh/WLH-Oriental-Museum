# wlhmuseum
By using html, css, and javascript, I created a website called the WLH Oriental Museum which aims to encourage more people to learn about Ancient Chinese Artifact, especially from the Song Dynasty.

In addition, I used python modules, namely re, and urllib to gather useful information online such as the pricing of artifact.
After that, I used python modules, including numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to create both 2D and 3D graphical presentation.
Finally, by using matplotlib animation, I recorded the graph and put it in my website.
