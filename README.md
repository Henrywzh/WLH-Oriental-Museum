# WLH Oriental Museum
Using HTML, CSS, and javascript, I created a website called the WLH Oriental Museum, which aims to encourage people to learn about Ancient Chinese Artefacts, especially from the Song Dynasty. Besides, I also used W3.CSS from w3school to refine the website.

Reading the article "Chinese arts as an investment" sparked my interest in the hedonic regression model for predictions. I then built a stock price model based on multiple regression using the hedonic pricing method. To improve the accuracy, I created a new multiple regression model with 5 variables(SMA, WMA, EMA, RSI, CCI) for future one-day stock price prediction.

In addition, I used python libraries, namely request, urllib and re, to gather useful information online, such as the pricing of the artefact.
Moreover, by using pytesseract and cv2, OCR modules, I gathered data from pdf files or photos. I then became curious about the mechanism behind OCR, so I studied Stanford University's cs231n course notes to build a neural network for digit recognition.
